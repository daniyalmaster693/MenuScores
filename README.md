## Features

- **Live Notch Scores** - Pin games to your notch and receive real-time score updates available at a glace.
- **Live Menubar Scores** - Pin games to your menu bar and receive real-time score updates available at a glance.
- **Smart Notifications** - Get notified when a pinned game starts or finishes.
- **League Control** - Choose which leagues are shown and stay focused on the sports you care about.
- **Configurable** - Configure notification types and refresh intervals to fit your preferences.
- **Lightweight & Native** - Built with Swift and SwiftUI for fast performance and seamless macOS integration.

## Installation

**Requires macOS 13.0 and later**

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release.
2. Move the app to your **Applications folder**.
3. Run the app and grant necessary permissions when prompted.

### Homebrew

You can also install MenuScores using Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap daniyalmaster693/casks
brew install --cask menuscores
```

**Note**: On first launch, macOS may warn that the app couldn't be verified. Click **OK**, then go to **System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security**, scroll down, and click **Open Anyway** to launch the app.

## Usage

- After running the app, you'll be greeted with a walkthrough that will provide information about the different features of the app, and security and privacy concerns.
- **In order to use the notifications feature**, you must grant permission for MenuScores to send notification. An option will be presented to do so in the walkthrough screen.

1. Clicking on the menubar title will show a list available leagues.
2. Hovering over a league will show a dropdown of all the games for the day in that league.
3. Hover over a game will allow you to choose from pinning the game to your menubar, notch, or viewing it in your browser.

**Note: the notch feature works best on Macbooks with a notch. It will still work on non notched devices, but hovering over it will not open the expanded view.**

4. You can use the clear set game option, or pin a different game to clear the title.
5. You can quit the app directly from the menubar, or open the preferences window to configure app behaviors (this can be done by pressing Cmd + , after opening the menubar component, or clicking the preferences button if your on macOS 14.0 and later).
